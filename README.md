# Getting Started

The app in the `master` branch, **doesn't** use _Redux_ already. I made this project in a primitive way first, to have a clear
understanding and once it was done, I moved to the `state/redux` branch to implement Redux.

**A plain little countdown timer, made for my series of Redux posts on Dev.to**

# `state/redux` branch
